This will compile and flash firmware that sets all pins on the microcontroller to HIGHZ state. 

It may be useful for testing, or a template to code your own firmware for the mojo V3 FPGA board 
(atmega atmega32U4 chip, not the Spartan6 FPGA).


#TO SET THE DEFAULT FUSES 
sudo avrdude -V -c usbtiny -p m32u4 -U lfuse:w:0x5e:m -U hfuse:w:0x99:m 

#OR FOR THE FULL DEFAULT FUSES (INCLUDING EFUSE): 
sudo avrdude -V -c usbtiny -p m32u4 -U lfuse:w:0x5e:m -U hfuse:w:0x99:m -U efuse:w:0xf3:m  



to test:

plug the device in and run "sudo dmesg"
if it assigns a /dev/SERIAL address than the firmare is working 
if not, the device is set to HIGHZ
